# Simplified Traffic Intersection Simulator

This Python project simulates a simplified traffic intersection to explore and visualize the effects of various traffic light control strategies on traffic flow. It was developed as part of a BScIT degree.

**Key Features:**

* **Visual Simulation:** Uses Pygame to provide a visual representation of the intersection, car movement, and traffic light changes.
* **Traffic Generation:** Randomly generates cars entering the intersection from four directions (North, South, East, West), allowing for adjustable traffic density.
* **Traffic Light Control:** Implements a basic fixed-time traffic light control system. (Can be extended to include more intelligent, traffic-responsive systems.)
* **Metrics Tracking:** Collects and displays important metrics such as average car waiting time, intersection throughput (number of cars passing through per unit time), and (optionally) collision counts.
* **Modular Design:** The code is organized into modules (car.py, traffic_light.py, etc.) for better readability and maintainability.

This simulation provides a foundation for understanding basic traffic management principles and exploring the impact of different traffic control algorithms.
